Codebook for tidy_data.txt
==========================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals where these signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.. 

The tidy_data.txt file contains variables that represent the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, averaged by subject for every activity. The list of variables in tidy_data.txt is listed below.

“Activity” gives the activity number ranging from 1-6 and “Activity Description” translates the activity number into text description of what the activity is (see activity_lables.txt for details). For every activity, the mean and std measurements are averaged across every individual subject to product one row of data for every pairwise combination of Activity and Subject, and the resulting values captured in one of the remaining variables.
